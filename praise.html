                                        I’ve probably watched our wedding video at least a hundred times. If not that then more – way more lol!! Any time I see something I missed the day of, I get teary-eyed. I’ve stopped, replayed, played, and recorded the screen so many times just to see the tiny details that I had missed out on that meant so much to me. To be honest – I have sat in bed most days watching my wedding video. It made my husband and I extremely happy and none of this would have happened if we did not choose to work with Joyful Vows. They are truly a team of one-of-a-kind people! Thank you so much!! The Fredrick’s! 09-23-18  </p>

                                        Joyful Vows was an utter pleasure! We had to change all of our wedding plans due to COVID-19 with less than a month until our wedding date! Talk about stress! With the help of Joyful Vows, we were able to book their videography and photography team during these tough times and they were extremely flexible and accessible and made me feel great knowing that everything was so last minute.

We got a hold of our pictures and videos ahead of the date we were promised which was extremely exciting and now for the hard part – deciding which ones we want to print!!  </p>

                                        Joyful Vows is the only way to go for your wedding media needs! My husband and I are so pleased with our wedding photos and video. I chose Joyful Vows because they offered both photo and video, they threw in extras (Instagram video, raw footage), they traveled, the price was right, and most importantly they were so nice, accommodating, and very communicative about the process!!

                                        For all of your wedding inquiries and needs, Joyful Vows is truly the team you want to hire for your wedding! My husband and I are so happy with the pictures and videos from our wedding. We chose Joyful Vows because they had what we needed such as drone footage and their prices were great especially their bundle packages! The team was very cooperative and made sure that both parties understood completely what would be covered throughout the wedding and everything turned out perfect! The team showed up early which was great and made me feel comfortable and made me less nervous by making my girls and I laugh which was GREAT and highly needed!

                                        We love the images and videos so much and have been reminiscing about them nonstop. We have gotten so many compliments on them, especially the video. We have watched it almost a couple thousand times LOL! It’s definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience that we’ll never forget. Thank you, Joyful Vows, for what you have done for me and my husband, we are extremely grateful to have worked with you guys.

                                        I’ve probably watched our wedding video at least a hundred times. If not that then more – way more lol!! Any time I see something I missed the day of, I get teary-eyed. I’ve stopped, replayed, played, and recorded the screen so many times just to see the tiny details that I had missed out on that meant so much to me. To be honest – I have sat in bed most days watching my wedding video. It made my husband and I extremely happy and none of this would have happened if we did not choose to work with Joyful Vows. They are truly a team of one-of-a-kind people! Thank you so much!! The Fredrick’s! 09-23-18  </p>

I couldn’t have asked for a better team than the team from Joyful Vows! The photographers and videographers had so many great ideas that I didn’t even have to guide them in any direction or tell them anything, they just knew and made our day memorable! The team really made us feel comfortable and I have bawled my eyes out just re-watching our videos and photos! This team is honestly the best and when we renew our vows later on down the road, we are going to hire them again!

                                        Our Joyful Vows team was very professional and fun to work with. They did an excellent job and know exactly what they’re doing and will recommend shots that will look best in your photos and videos. I would 100% work with them again if I could. Our wedding video is just what we were looking for. They were outstanding and phenomenal!

                                        On November 1, 2020, my husband and I got married in Phoenix, Arizona. We chose to work with Joyful Vows because they were the most professional and had great photo + video packages. The videos were captured like a movie and they captured all of the beautiful details and moments from our wedding, and we were so happy with how they turned out.

                                        We couldn’t have picked a more perfect team to work with us and make our perfect day memorable! They were on time and highly professional and courteous. Our video was completed in such a short amount of time and we are completely enamored with it! They did a fantastic job with the editing. Our wedding footage was better than I had expected. With the mics they set up, you could hear everything perfectly and we couldn’t have asked for a better team to bring this day all together. Thank you, Joyful Vows!

                                        As a bride, photography and videography was SUPER important to me, and it was one of the areas of costs I did not want to cut corners on; however, Joyful Vows had great pricing and bundles that I took advantage of and the quality and experience of everything was so much better than I had anticipated. The photographers and videographers assigned to our wedding were meticulous in sticking to our schedule and capturing all of the poses and photos I had submitted photos of on my Pinterest boards. They made my husband and I feel at ease and encouraged us to be silly and have a good time, which showed in our photos. They’re also incredibly cooperative and replied within a day which was GREAT.  They also asked ahead of time what was the most important aspect to us to include in the video and incorporated that. We also received a hard drive containing all of our photos and a breakdown of the entire day. We really can’t say it enough, but this was the best team to work with and I would choose to work with them again in a heartbeat if I could.
